SQL Codes

Part 2: Business Insights Queries (MySQL / SQLite)

1. Use strftime('%m', Date) for month (SQLite equivalent of EXTRACT(MONTH FROM Date))

SELECT 
    strftime('%m', Date) AS month,
    SUM("Total Revenue") AS monthly_revenue
FROM 
    sales_data
GROUP BY 
    month
ORDER BY 
    month;

2. GROUP BY month (Transaction volume by month)

SELECT 
    strftime('%m', Date) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT "Transaction ID") AS transactions
FROM 
    sales_data
GROUP BY 
    month
ORDER BY 
    month;

3. SUM() for revenue (Revenue by product category)

SELECT 
    "Product Category",
    SUM("Total Revenue") AS total_revenue
FROM 
    sales_data
GROUP BY 
    "Product Category"
ORDER BY 
    total_revenue DESC;

4. COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) for volume (Total transactions)

SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT "Transaction ID") AS total_transactions
FROM 
    sales_data;

5. ORDER BY for sorting (Revenue by product name)

SELECT 
    "Product Name",
    SUM("Total Revenue") AS revenue
FROM 
    sales_data
GROUP BY 
    "Product Name"
ORDER BY 
    revenue DESC;

6A. Filter for recent 6 months (Units sold by product name)

SELECT 
    "Product Name",
    SUM("Units Sold") AS total_units
FROM 
    sales_data
WHERE 
    Date >= date('now', '-6 months')
GROUP BY 
    "Product Name"
ORDER BY 
    total_units DESC;

6B. Top 5 products by revenue

SELECT 
    "Product Name",
    SUM("Total Revenue") AS revenue
FROM 
    sales_data
GROUP BY 
    "Product Name"
ORDER BY 
    revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
